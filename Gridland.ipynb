    "## Mo solution\n",
    "First off we consider the following:\n",
    "+ If the prince begins his journey in a city that is on a corner, the prince has three plays:\n",
    "1. loop all the way around to the right\n",
    "2. loop all the way around to the left\n",
    "3. snake. Since we know what corner the prince is starting from there is only one snaking move\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If the prince begins his journey from a non corner at say index i of the upper string. He begins his journey by either\n",
    "1. looping to the left  until he is directly below or above where he started.\n",
    "2. looping to the right until he is directly below or above where he started.\n",
    "3. After this loop is complete, we save the route and concatenate the set of strings generated from a sub journey, where the prince is now starting at a corner of a sub province if you will.\n",
    "\n",
    "So... the key part of the solution is to create a recursive function get_routes.\n",
    "This function takes as inputs the grid to traverse (upper string and lower string) and which corner we started at (ll,lr,ul,ur) . It returns a list of strings satisfying the acceptable paths the prince can take.\n",
